## About SweaterWeather

### App Description
SweaterWeather is an app that allows users to input their current location's zipcode (or any location for which they want to see the current weather) and see whether or not wearing a sweater is recommended, based on that location's current weather.

## App Features

### User Authentication & Authorization
This allows users to register as SweaterWeather users with a username, password, and email, ensuring secure access to app features.

### Current Weather Conditions
Utilizing the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) users can input a zipcode and the API will provide current temperature, conditions, wind speed, and "feels like" temperature.
